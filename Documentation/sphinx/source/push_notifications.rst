Push Notifications
=========================================

Enabling Apple Notification Push Service (APNS) for your application
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Enabling Notifications for your Socialize SDK just take a few steps.  High-level concepts are covered in 
`Apple's documentation <http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html>`_,
but the Socialize SDK takes care of the low-level implementation details of notifications for you letting you focus on developing your application specific code.

Configuring Your Apple App ID
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable APNS for your application you'll first have to configure your App ID in `Apple's developer portal <https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/bundles/index.action>`.   
App IDs are an integral part of the iOS Development and Socialize that allows an application to communicate with the Apple Push Notification Service.  You can configure your App ID here:
https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/bundles/index.action

Keys/Certificates for your App ID for APNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

APNS security is based on private/public key pairs (X.509) and signing certificates.  To start the process click the 'configure' button on the right hand side and follow the directions 
given to you by Apple **very carefully**.  Once you've completed the steps make sure you download the certificate and double-click on the certificate. 
This should result in the 'Keychain Access' application opening. 

.. note:: You donâ€™t have to use your primary Keychain key as the identifier, nor does it have to connect to your developer account.   You can make a new keychain in Keychain Access, and use that to handle the Certificate Signing Request. This can be especially useful if you need to share this between multiple developers.

Exporting your .p12 (key/certificate pair) from the Keychain Access tool.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After you've downloaded and double-clicked the certificate it should automatically open the 'Keychain Access' tool. Then find they 'My Certificates' category on the left hand side of the 
'Keychain Access' tool.  Right click on the 'Apple Production iOS Push Services' and export the key/certificate pair in the p12 (Personal Information Exchange) format.  
Save this file without a password and upload it to our developer portal.

Uploading your .p12 to the Socialize Developer Portal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To upload you'll need to get to the application dashboard: http://www.getsocialize.com/apps/ and select the application for which you want to configure.  If you've added a 
password to your p12 in the previous step make sure to put that in.

Configuring Socialize in Your App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure your app you'll need to register for notifications and handle the notification response.


Register for Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To configure Socialize inside the app, the minimum you'll need to do is register for notifications.  Run the application, and see that you get the push notification request pop-up. 
If you do not get it, you might be using the wrong provisioning profile.

Handle Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For notifications you'll have to handle notifications.  Our method call knows whether the notification was meant for the Socialize SDK and if not, it allows you to handle the 
application specific notification.
