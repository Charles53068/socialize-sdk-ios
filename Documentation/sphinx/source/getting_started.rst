Minimum Requirements

Installing the SDK
------------------
- Download and unzip the lastest iOS SDK release from the website.  You can find it here: http://www.getsocialize.com/sdk/

- Add CoreGraphics.framework to your application target.
- Add CoreLocation.framework to your application target.
- Add MapKit.framework to your application target.
- Add QuartzCore.framework to your application target.
- Add MessageUI.framework to your application target.

*Additional Configuration*

- First of all, you should be sure that Socialize.framework and resources from the Resources folder were added as the dependence to the correct target.
- Add **-ObjC** and **-all_load** flag to the Other Linker Flags in the build settings of your application target. *Please use the flag exactly as it isâ€”the most common mistake here tends to be misspelling or incorrect capitalization.*
