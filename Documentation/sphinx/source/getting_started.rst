Minimum Requirements
--------------------

iOS 4 is minimum supported version by this SDK. 

Installing the SDK
------------------

- Install the embedded static framework to your application. To do this just drag and drop Socialize-IOS.embeddedframework from project root (i.e. socialize-sdk-ios folder) to your framework section.

- Add CoreGraphics.framework to your application target.
- Add CoreLocation.framework to your application target.
- Add MapKit.framework to your application target.
- Add QuartzCore.framework to your application target.

*Additional Configuration*

- First of all, you should be sure that Socialize-iOS.framework and resources from the Resources folder were added as the dependence to the correct target.
- Add **-ObjC** and **-all_load** flag to the Other Linker Flags in the build settings of your application target. *Please use the flag exactly as it isâ€”the most common mistake here tends to be misspelling or incorrect capitalization.*
